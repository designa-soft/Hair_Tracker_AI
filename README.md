Hair Tracker AI

Hair Tracker AI is an advanced AI-powered application that leverages machine learning models to provide tailored solutions for various hair-related concerns. The app uses four distinct models to address common issues such as hair loss prediction, product recommendations, hair type classification, and overall hair health monitoring. The datasets used for these models are sourced from Kaggle, ensuring robust training and reliable predictions.
